# Data-Analysis-Using-Python
# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

This project provides a detailed exploratory data analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic using Python and its powerful data analysis libraries. It showcases how to clean, analyze, and visualize real-world data to extract meaningful insights.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The analysis is performed on a COVID-19 dataset and aims to:

- Explore the spread of COVID-19 across different regions
- Identify trends in confirmed, recovered, and death cases
- Answer specific questions using data groupings and aggregations 

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack Used

- **Python 3**
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** – for data visualization
- **Seaborn** – for advanced plotting and aesthetics
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for interactive coding

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes daily records of COVID-19 cases across different regions.  
It contains fields such as:
- `Date` 
- `Region`
- `Confirmed`
- `Recovered` 
- `Deaths`  

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

- Displayed top 20 records with highest confirmed cases
- Identified region with maximum and minimum:
  - Confirmed cases
  - Recovered cases
  - Deaths
- Filtered data where:
  - Confirmed cases are greater than X
  - Recovered cases are less than Y
- Grouped data by regions and dates to extract trends

---

## 📌 Sample Questions Solved

- In which region were the maximum confirmed cases recorded?
- Which regions had the least number of deaths?
- How do recoveries compare across regions?
- What trends can be observed over time?

---

## ✅ Results & Insights

- Certain regions showed significantly higher confirmed cases and death rates
- Recovery patterns varied across time and location
- Correlation between confirmed and recovered cases was strong

---

## 🧠 Learnings

- Practical use of Pandas for real-world datasets
- Enhanced data storytelling using Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Stronger understanding of EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
